      <p>
        Hello and welcome! Let's totally ignore that there is already search and
        randomize functionalities already built into the XKCD website.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that I have your attention, you can use the following tabs above to
        either gander at a random XKCD or you can search by number for your
        favorite XKCD.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was built with the power of REACT. For the people, and mostly for a
        project.
